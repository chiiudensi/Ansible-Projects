# Ansible-Projects


## Overview
This repository contains two Ansible projects:

Package Management Project: Uses Ansible to install and update packages on multiple remote systems from a central control node.
AWS Resource Management Project: Uses Ansible to create and manage AWS resources, executed from an EC2 instance.


## 1. Package Management Project
Description
The purpose of this project is to manage the installation and updating of software packages across a fleet of systems using Ansible. The Ansible control node is responsible for managing remote servers by executing playbooks to install, update, and remove packages.

## 2. AWS Resource Management Project
